GENERAL NOTES
=============

Description: 
	
	vbJaEngine is an attempt to provide other indie programmers the base 
	functionality to facilitate the creation of content for the Nintendo 
	Virtual Boy by taking care of most hardware management task to create 
	3D games with 2D graphics or "sprites".


Features:

	 General features:
		* Automatic frame rate control
		* Generic clocks based on hardware interrupts
		* Memory Pool to allocate memory dynamically
		* Easy to use printing functions to facilitate debug
		* Generic parenting system
		* Generic messaging system
		* Generic state Machines
		* Generic clocks based on hardware interrupts
	 Object Oriented support through the use of Metaprogramming (C MACROS):
		* Inheritance
		* Polymorphism
		* Encapsulation
	 Rendering:
		* Automatic char memory allocation
		* Automatic bgmap memory allocation
		* Automatic world layer assignment based on the object占퐏 z position
		* Scaling/rotation effects
		* Automatic projection/parallax/scale calculation and rendering
		* Customizable perspective/deep effects on real time
		* Automatic memory allocation for Param tables (used in affine and h-bias modes).
	 Animation:
		* Multiple memory allocation schemas to improve efficiency
		* Frame based animation system with callback support
	 Sound:
		* Sound reproduction of one BGM and up to two FX sounds simultaneous.
	 Physics:
		* Accelerated/uniform movement
		* Gravity
		* Friction
		* Automatic Collision detection and notification.
	 Stages:
		* 3D stages
		* Automatic object streaming
	 Useful classes to speed up the content creation process:
		* Actors
		* Images
		* Backgrounds
		* Scrolling

COMPILING ON WIN32
==================

Requirements: 

	 Minimal Linux environment (i.e: CygWin)
	
	 GCCVB 4.4.2 for V810 


1. Create a CygWin environment variable called VBJAENGINE which must point to the vbJaEngine's folder.

2. Replace the crt0.o file created by gccvb with the one provided with this source code:

	$ cp -f /usr/local/v810/lib/crt0.o /usr/local/v810/lib/crt0.o.bak
	$ cp -f $VBJAENGINE/lib/crt0.o /usr/local/v810/lib/crt0.o
 
3. To compile the execute the following command inside the engine's folder:

	$ make

	This will produce the file libvbjae.a which must be linked agains the game's code.


COMPILING ON GNU/LINUX
==================

Requirements: 

	 GCCVB 4.4.2 for V810


1. Create an environment variable called VBJAENGINE which must point to the vbJaEngine's folder.

2. As root replace the crt0.o file created by gccvb with the one provided with this source code:

	# cp -f /usr/local/v810/lib/crt0.o /usr/local/v810/lib/crt0.o.bak
	# cp -f $VBJAENGINE/lib/crt0.o /usr/local/v810/lib/crt0.o
 
3. To compile the execute the following command inside the engine's folder:

	$ make

	This will produce the file libvbjae.a which must be linked agains the game's code.


ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
==================

	 David Tucker, for always being open to answer all my questions (even the silly ones).
	
	 DogP, for all the performace tips which really helped this project to be feasible, and
	  for providing the code necessary to make sound support possible in the engine. 
	
	 Christian Radke (KR155E), for helping me with the documentation, debbuging, and all the other little 
	  tasks that I can't remeber.
	  
	 RunnerPack, DanB, Dasi and all the other people in Planet Virtual Boy develpment forums 
	  who always are kind enough to share their knowledge. 

	 Libgccvb has been refactored to accomodate better to this engine, all it's code is credited to
	  it's creators and Jorge Eremiev doesn't take any credit on it.

==================  

V810 is a trade mark of NEC.
Virtual Boy is a trade mark of Nintendo.

Jorge Eremiev is in no way affiliated with either of these parties.
