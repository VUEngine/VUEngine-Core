	"Seiryu" Virtual Boy Library

	A collaborative effort by:

	Amos "RunnerPack" Bieler		Slapped it together and inserted most of the errors ;)
	Alberto "Virtual-E" Covarrubias	Made veCC (and the library upon which this one is based) and a TON of other VB tools.
	Cody "frostgiant" Planteen		Deciphered the sound hardware and made the sound routines.
	David Tucker					Oh, he only STARTED THE WHOLE VB DEV'ING SCENE!!!!!
	"Parasyte"						Made the crt0.o and linker script, among MANY other things.
	Pat "DogP" Daderko				Investigated many hardware specs to help improve emulator compatibility.
	And probably others...			(You know who you are!)

	BTW, "Seiryu" (sigh-roo) is a variety of Japanese Red-Leaf Maple tree.
