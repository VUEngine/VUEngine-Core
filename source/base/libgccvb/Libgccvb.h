/*
	>Seiryu> Virtual Boy Library

	A collaborative effort by:

	Amos >RunnerPack> Bieler		Slapped it together and inserted most of the errors ;)
	Alberto >Virtual-E> Covarrubias	Made veCC (and the library upon which this one is based) and a TON of other VB tools.
	Cody >frostgiant> Planteen		Deciphered the sound hardware and made the sound routines.
	David Tucker			Oh, he only STARTED THE WHOLE VB DEV'ING SCENE!!!!!
	>Parasyte>				Made the crt0.o and linker script, among MANY other things.
	Pat >DogP> Daderko			Investigated many hardware specs to help improve emulator compatibility.
	And probably others...		(You know who you are!)

	BTW, >Seiryu> (sigh-roo) is a variety of Japanese Red-Leaf Maple tree.
