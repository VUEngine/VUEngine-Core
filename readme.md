VUEngine
========

VUEngine ("Virtual Utopia Engine", based on the Virtual Boy's code name, "Virtual Utopia Experience") 
is an attempt to provide other indie developers the base functionality to facilitate the creation of 
content for the Nintendo Virtual Boy by taking care of most hardware management tasks to create 3D games 
with 2D graphics.

Features:

- General features:
	- Automatic frame rate control
	- Generic clocks based on hardware interrupts
	- Memory Pool to allocate memory dynamically
	- Generic state machines
	- Generic parenting system
	- Generic messaging system
	- Generic event listening/firing system
	- Easy to use printing functions to facilitate debug
	- User data saving support
	- Program's memory layout management
		- Use DRAM as WRAM
		- Use SRAM as WRAM
		- Variables' in-program-section allocation control
- Object Oriented support through the use of Metaprogramming (C MACROS):
	- Simple inheritance
	- Polymorphism
	- Encapsulation
	- Friend classes support
	- Runtime type checking
- Rendering:
	- Automatic CHAR memory allocation
	- Real time CHAR memory defragmentation
	- Automatic BGMAP memory allocation
	- Automatic OBJECT memory allocation
	- Automatic WORLD layer assignment based on the objects' z position
	- Texture preloading & recycling
	- Scaling/rotation effects
	- Transparency
	- Automatic projection/parallax/scale calculations and rendering
	- Customizable perspective/deep effects in real time
	- Automatic memory allocation for param tables (used in affine and h-bias modes)
- Animation:
	- Multiple memory allocation schemas to improve efficiency
	- Frame based animation system with callback support
- Sound:
	- Sound reproduction of one BGM and up to two FX sounds simultaneous.
- Physics:
	- Basic accelerated/uniform movement
	- Gravity
	- Friction
	- Bouncing
	- Automatic collision detection and notification
- Particles:
	- Physically based particles
	- Recyclable particles
- Stages:
	- 3D stages
	- Level streaming
- Debugging / Development:
	- Memory usage
	- Profiling data
	- Streaming status
	- Hardware registers' usage
	- Real time tools to check:
		- CHAR memory status
		- BGMAP memory status
		- WORLD layer status
	- Collision boxes
	- Real time stage editor
	- Real time animation inspector
- Useful classes to speed up the content creation process:
	- Container: for transformation propagation (translation/rotation/scaling)
	- Entity: a container with a list of sprites (a "visual object")
	- AnimatedEntity: an entity with animated sprites
	- Actor: animated entity that has a physical body and can resolve collisions

GENERAL NOTES
-------------

A short summary of the file layout:

- assets: engine default font, etc
- doc: Documentation
- lib: precompiler, miscellaneous files needed for linking, etc.
- source: VUEngine source code.
- source/base/libgccvb: heavily modified libgccvb


ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
---------------

- David Tucker, for always being open to answer all my questions (even the silly ones).
- DogP, for all the performance tips which really helped this project to be feasible, and
for providing the code necessary to make sound support possible in the engine.
- RunnerPack, DanB, Dasi and all the other people in Planet Virtual Boy development forums
who always are kind enough to share their knowledge.
- ElmerPCFX, for giving access to a much better compiler through his GCC 4.7 patches, and for all
the tips, suggestions and knowledge about best practices and bad practices (of which the engine was
previously plagued with).
- Libgccvb has been refactored to accommodate better to this engine, all its code is credited to
its creators, we do not take any credit on it.
- Thunderstruck, for sharing with us the source of his MIDI and PCM music players and converters.

V810 is a trade mark of NEC. Virtual Boy is a trade mark of Nintendo.
